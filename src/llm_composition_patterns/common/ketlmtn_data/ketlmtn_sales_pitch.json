The fabric is super stretchy, lightweight, breathable, and still surprisingly durable. It repels water, prevents stains, and dries fast enough to use for swimming, comfortable enough to lounge in, stretchier than you are, flexible, and breathable enough to keep those family jewels as cool as cucumbers. The waistband is as stretchy as the rest of the shorts, but when you want to snug things up, you have a full length internal belt and our signature anti-plumber's crack technology to keep things snug and in place. There's a zipper pocket on the front right, back right, and a button on the back left to keep whatever you put in your pockets safe and secure. Ride bikes, swim, run, hike, or do whatever floats your boat in these shorts. They will work for everything, and that is precisely the point. If you're familiar with the first version of the virtue shorts, here's a quick rundown on what we refined for version 2: updated sizing that is much more true to size, more colors and inseam length offerings, and a more secure flush and dialed in closure system. As with all Kettle Mountain apparel, these shorts come with a lifetime warranty because we genuinely stand behind the products that we design and create, also free shipping, free returns and exchanges, and of course, shorts that are made to help amplify the amount of fun when you wear them."

Trust us, with our quadruple density, Italian-made chamois, your little cobblers and cheeks will feel as if they are floating on silk pillows! No chafing, no constriction, just comfort intentionally designed with padding only where you need it, and not where you don't.

This bib is for the men that want to go fast, stay cool, and look good while doing it, not be caught dealing with wedgies, which is exactly why we chose premium fabrics mixed with thoughtful design features, like silicone-lined leg openings to prevent slippage, breathable mesh back panel for perfect ventilation, and flat lock seams. Did you think we forgot about snack storage? How could we? The Canyon Bib features large and stretchy triple back pockets with plenty of room for food, drinks, tools, and whatever your heart desires! You might even be able to fit that gigantic submarine sandwich in there, because you're a real man, and real men order extra-large sandwiches they can't finish but will die trying.

    "product_name": "Folly Active Travel Hoodie V.2 (Zip-Up)",
    "sales_pitch": "These are the Folly hoodies. Our mission with these was to make a packable, good hoodie for traveling that had a perfect balance between warmth, breathability, and basically good stretchy, lightweight fabric. It's not lightweight like t-shirt lightweight, but it's also not one of those heavy thick cotton hoodies you might be used to, offered in zip as well as pull over. We packed a ton of features into these things. Most notably with these things, really, is the fabric. It's a dual face fabric with a water repellent exterior and a nice soft buttery soft fleece on the inside. The zippers have large teeth for nice smooth operation, zipper pockets all around, kangaroo on the pullover, and then obviously hand pockets here on the zip. Tucked in a nice little waist cord right here, so you can adjust basically how tight that waist is. The hood, one of my favorite things about the hood is that the drawstring will never be too far down on one side because it is actually bar tacked at the top of the hood, so it will always stay in there throughout washing it and not get totally uneven on you and just not go away, which is really convenient with these things. Flat lock stitching throughout, and basically just a good packable, lightweight travel hoodie that should hit all the nails on the head that you're looking for in an active sport hoodie to travel with."
